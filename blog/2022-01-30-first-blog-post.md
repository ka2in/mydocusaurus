In localization, RTL (Right-to-Left) refers to languages that read from right to left, such as Arabic and Hebrew.

As someone who grew up in a bilingual environment, i.e. Arabic and French, making the difference between languages with opposite script directions is the most natural thing in the world. That being said, I recently had an amusing incident that I would like to relate here.

It all began when I attended a webinar about the role of pictures in intercultural communication some weeks ago. The speaker, who was using a Japanese brochure to illustrate an example of non-Latin scripts, started talking about RTL languages and confusing both directions which are in fact opposite to each other.

During five minutes that seemed like an eternity, our speaker kept using the acronym RTL to refer to a Right-to-Left layout while erroneously telling the audience that RTL was an acronym for Left-to-Right.

To my surprise, nobody from the attendees called his attention to the mistake. It seemed like the attendees were applying the Gestalt principles of organization at that moment, correcting by themselves the inaccurate information.

So, what about the Japanese language? Is it an RTL or an LTR script? Well, both answers are true. ðŸ˜Ž In Fact, you can write Japanese in both directions depending on the writing system you are applying:

- Tategaki (vertical writing): starting at the top of the right-hand column, then moving to the next vertical column on the left;
- Yokogaki (horizontal writing): from left to right like European Romance languages.
