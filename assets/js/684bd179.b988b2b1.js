That being said, I recently had an amusing incident that I would like to relate here.\\n\\n![Labyrinth and directions](./directions.jpg)<br />\\nPicture by the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/) under [CC BY 2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/) license\\n\\nIt all began when I attended a webinar about the role of pictures in intercultural communication some weeks ago. The speaker, who was using a Japanese brochure to illustrate an example of non-Latin scripts, started talking about RTL languages and confusing both directions, which in fact are opposite to each other.\\n\\nDuring five minutes that seemed like an eternity, our speaker kept using the acronym RTL to refer to a Right-to-Left layout while erroneously telling the audience that RTL was an acronym for Left-to-Right.\\n\\n![RTL or LTR](./two-way.png)<br />\\n*Right-to-Left or Left-to-Right? Help is on the way!<br />*\\nPicture by [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) under [CC BY-SA 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en) license\\n\\nTo my surprise, nobody from the attendees called his attention to the mistake. It seemed like the participants had the &ldquo;autocorrect&rdquo; function turned on in their brain, correcting by themselves the inaccurate information.\\n\\nSo, what about the Japanese language? Is it an RTL or an LTR script? Well, both answers are true. \ud83d\ude0e In Fact, you can write Japanese in both directions depending on the writing system you are applying:\\n\\n- Tategaki (vertical writing): starting at the top of the right-hand column, then moving to the next vertical column on the left;\\n- Yokogaki (horizontal writing): from left to right like European Romance languages.\\n\\nIf you are curious to know more about the reading direction in Japanese, I suggest you read the article [&ldquo;Is Japanese Read from Right to Left or Left to Right?&rdquo;](https://teamjapanese.com/japanese-read-right-left/) by Team Japanese.\\n\\nGetting back to our presentation, it was quite interesting, but it had some flaws from the &ldquo;intercultural&rdquo; standpoint. Allow me to explain why. \\n\\nAt a certain stage of the presentation, the speaker showed an antique artwork from the Arab-Islamic World, and pointed out that artists from the aforesaid region used ornaments because drawing human beings is not allowed for religious reasons.\\n\\nWhile it is partly true that artists from the Arab-Islamic World have used biomorphic design at a later stage as an integral part of their artwork (e.g. use of vegetal shapes and forms, also known as &ldquo;al-Tawr\u012bq&rdquo;), the major part of these artistic creations are based on calligraphy and geometry by deriving patterns from basic geometric shapes, such as circles and squares. \\n\\nA little introduction to the topic is the article [&ldquo;Geometry - The Language of Symmetry in Islamic Art&rdquo;](https://artofislamicpattern.com/resources/educational-posters/) by Richard Henry.\\n\\nThe second shortcoming in the presentation was related to the examples that were selected to reflect cultural differences in technical documentation. \\n\\nJudging by the names appearing in the attendees list, I suppose that I was the only non-European in the meeting room. It was striking to see that the examples used were too ethnocentric, to say the least. \\n\\nPersonally, I think that the choice of the examples was a big *faux pas*, and that they would cause real indignation among the attendees if the presentation were to be held in front of a non-European audience (e.g. in an Asian or African country). \\n\\nDear speaker, you are shooting yourself in the foot with such examples. If you have any non-European students, ask them what they think about your examples. You may need to adapt your content as soon as possible to avoid any misunderstandings with international audiences. \\n\\nAfter all, your presentation is supposed to address intercultural challenges in technical communication.\\n\\n\\nCopyright \xa9 GlobalTech Translations 2002."},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/mydocusaurus/blog/welcome","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2022-01-29-welcome/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-01-29-welcome/index.md","title":"Welcome","description":"Docusaurus blogging features are powered by the blog plugin.","date":"2022-01-29T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 29, 2022","tags":[{"label":"blog","permalink":"/mydocusaurus/blog/tags/blog"},{"label":"docusaurus","permalink":"/mydocusaurus/blog/tags/docusaurus"},{"label":"rtl","permalink":"/mydocusaurus/blog/tags/rtl"},{"label":"l10n","permalink":"/mydocusaurus/blog/tags/l-10-n"}],"readingTime":0.465,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Faycal Alami-Hassani","title":"Website\'s owner","url":"https://github.com/ka2in","imageURL":"https://github.com/ka2in.png","key":"faycal"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"welcome","title":"Welcome","authors":["faycal"],"tags":["blog","docusaurus","rtl","l10n"],"url":"https://github.com/ka2in","image_url":"https://github.com/ka2in.png"},"prevItem":{"title":"RTL, LTR, and Absent-Mindedness","permalink":"/mydocusaurus/blog/first-blog-post"},"nextItem":{"title":"MDX Blog Post","permalink":"/mydocusaurus/blog/mdx-blog-post"}},"content":"[Docusaurus blogging features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog) are powered by the [blog plugin](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-blog).\\n\\nSimply add Markdown files (or folders) to the `blog` directory.\\n\\nRegular blog authors can be added to `authors.yml`.\\n\\nThe blog post date can be extracted from filenames, such as:\\n\\n- `2019-05-30-welcome.md`\\n- `2019-05-30-welcome/index.md`\\n\\nA blog post folder can be convenient to co-locate blog post images:\\n\\n![EFF Data Privacy](./printer-eff.jpg)<br />\\nPicture by the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/) under [CC BY 2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/) Licence\\n\\nThe blog supports tags as well!\\n\\n**If you don\'t want a blog**: just delete this directory, and use `blog: false` in your Docusaurus config."},{"id":"mdx-blog-post","metadata":{"permalink":"/mydocusaurus/blog/mdx-blog-post","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2021-08-01-mdx-blog-post.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2021-08-01-mdx-blog-post.mdx","title":"MDX Blog Post","description":"Blog posts support Docusaurus Markdown features, such as MDX.","date":"2021-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 1, 2021","tags":[{"label":"docusaurus","permalink":"/mydocusaurus/blog/tags/docusaurus"}],"readingTime":0.175,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"S\xe9bastien Lorber","title":"Docusaurus maintainer","url":"https://sebastienlorber.com","imageURL":"https://github.com/slorber.png","key":"slorber"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"mdx-blog-post","title":"MDX Blog Post","authors":["slorber"],"tags":["docusaurus"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Welcome","permalink":"/mydocusaurus/blog/welcome"},"nextItem":{"title":"Long Blog Post","permalink":"/mydocusaurus/blog/long-blog-post"}},"content":"Blog posts support [Docusaurus Markdown features](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features), such as [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).\\n\\n:::tip\\n\\nUse the power of React to create interactive blog posts.\\n\\n```js\\n<button onClick={() => alert(\'button clicked!\')}>Click me!</button>\\n```\\n\\n<button onClick={() => alert(\'button clicked!\')}>Click me!</button>\\n\\n:::"},{"id":"long-blog-post","metadata":{"permalink":"/mydocusaurus/blog/long-blog-post","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2019-05-29-long-blog-post.md","source":"@site/blog/2019-05-29-long-blog-post.md","title":"Long Blog Post","description":"This is the summary of a very long blog post,","date":"2019-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 29, 2019","tags":[{"label":"hello","permalink":"/mydocusaurus/blog/tags/hello"},{"label":"docusaurus","permalink":"/mydocusaurus/blog/tags/docusaurus"}],"readingTime":0.165,"truncated":true,"authors":[{"name":"Endilie Yacop Sucipto","title":"Maintainer of Docusaurus","url":"https://github.com/endiliey","imageURL":"https://github.com/endiliey.png","key":"endi"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"long-blog-post","title":"Long Blog Post","authors":"endi","tags":["hello","docusaurus"]},"prevItem":{"title":"MDX Blog Post","permalink":"/mydocusaurus/blog/mdx-blog-post"}},"content":"This is the summary of a very long blog post,\\n\\nUse a `\x3c!--` `truncate` `--\x3e` comment to limit blog post size in the list view.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nThis page is still empty.
